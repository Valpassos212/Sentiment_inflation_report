# Sentiment inflation report
This code  produces simple word frequency and sentiment plots based on the Central Bank of Brazil inflation reports. 
I used the English version of the reports. You will see that this version was not published for sometime in the recent past, therefore, the sentiment serie jumps from 2011-06 to  2016-09.
