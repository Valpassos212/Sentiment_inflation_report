# Sentiment_inflation_report
This code is used to produce simple word frequency and sentiment plots of Central Bank of Brazil quarterly inflation report. 
I used the English version of the reports and you will see that this was not published for sometime in the recente past, therefore, the sentiment series stop from 2011-09 to  2016-06.
